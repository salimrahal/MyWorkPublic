V2

 Improvement:
- adding help page
- improving the back-end design/processing
- bug fixing

Some characteristics of the App: 
a- it uses some ports in this range:  5095 -> 5125

b- The real test time will be greater than the time length options [15 ,30, 60 sec], since each sub-test takes a separate time equal to the time length choosed by the user. (appreciatively: real test time = test length * 3)
Example: when user choose 15 sec as time length:
1- latency: 15 sec
2- upstream packet loss :15 sec
3- downstream packet loss :15 sec

total test time: 15*3 =~ 45 sec
