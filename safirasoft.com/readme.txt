Nope, just upload and activate. There are not options, so the code'll do the rest.

= What in the world is a Gravatar? =
**A Globally Recognized Avatar** - Your Gravatar is an image that follows you from site to site appearing beside your name when you do things like comment or post on a blog. Avatars help identify your posts on blogs and web forums, so why not on any site?

*From the [Gravatar.com](http://www.gravatar.com) website*
