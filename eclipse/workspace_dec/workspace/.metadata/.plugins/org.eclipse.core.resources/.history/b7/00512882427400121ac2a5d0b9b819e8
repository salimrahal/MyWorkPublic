	 * 
	 * Although using System.out to write to the console is still permissible
	 * under Java, its use is recommended mostly for debugging purposes or for
	 * sample programs, such as those found in this book. For real-world
	 * programs, the recommended method of writing to the console when using
	 * Java is through a PrintWriter stream. PrintWriter is one of the
	 * character-based classes. Using a character-based class for console output
	 * makes it easier to internationalize your program.
	 * 
	 * PrintWriter defines several constructors. The one we will use is shown
	 * here:
	 * 
	 * PrintWriter(OutputStream outputStream, boolean flushOnNewline)
	 * 
	 * Here, outputStream is an object of type OutputStream, and flushOnNewline
	 * controls whether Java flushes the output stream every time a newline
	 * ('\\n') character is output. If flushOnNewline is true, flushing
	 * automatically takes place. If false, flushing is not automatic.
	 * 
	 * PrintWriter supports the print( ) and println( ) methods for all types
	 * including Object. Thus, you can use these methods in the same way as they
	 * have been used with System.out. If an argument is not a simple type, the
	 * PrintWriter methods call the object's toString( ) method and then print
	 * the result.
	 * 
	 * To write to the console by using a PrintWriter, specify System.out for
	 * the output stream and flush the stream after each newline. For example,
	 * this line of code creates a PrintWriter that is connected to console
	 * output:
	 * 
	 * PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(System.out, true);
	 * 
	 * The following application illustrates using a PrintWriter to handle
	 * console output:
	 * @throws Exception
