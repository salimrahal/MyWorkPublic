This is your new Play application
=====================================
http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.0/JavaTodoList 
This file will be packaged with your application, when using `play dist`.

Java+HTML
Assignment is designed to test your skills with Java and modern web applications. There is no need to do user input validation, paging or browser compatibility. It is OK if it works in one browser of your choice (Chrome is preferred). Also there is no need for images, do all layout using CSS styles only. Visual design will not be assessed, although your output should be neat and organized. As deliverable, please provide the source code of the website and launch instructions. 

Tier 1:
Using Play framework (http://www.playframework.com/), create an Eclipse or IntelliJ project for a website:
- It should be a single-page HTML5 application
- Has a welcome screen with word “Welcome” when it opens
- When you click the Welcome, a transition happens (any transition you like) to a page with two tabs: Chemistry and CS:Software Engineering. 
- When a tab is clicked, it loads and displays a list of respective classes from coursera.org (there is no need for paging, just load what comes up initially).

Tier 2:
Extend the above with the following:
- Clicking on a course in the list should dim the background and open the popup with comments and a textarea and submit button for new comment
- Clicking “submit” will save the comment to the in-memory database (H2) and it will be shown in the comments on the comments popup for this course

We are OK if you do Tier 1 only, but completing Tier 2, at least partially, will improve your chances.
